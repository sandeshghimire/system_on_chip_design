# TCL that reads from a pushbutton and writes to LEDS (via Avalon MM)
# First while loop writes to the LEDs where the LED pio is at address 0x180 (Qsys environment)
# This section  was only used for testing that the LEDS were writing correctly
# Second while loop reads and writes to the register of LEDS and thus the LEDs, depending on the pushbutton 
# The addresses after the $jtag_master need to match the base env in the Qsys 
# When using this code on other boards, what needs to be changed is
#	1) Base addresses of the LEDs
#	2) Base addresses of the PIOs
#	3) Verify that LEDS and PIOs are on the same master (eg in Qsys, the same memory master)
#	If this is not the case, the memory master needs to be changed
# The System Console test Message will show that the test is done, but the push buttons can be still pushed to change the LEDs
# as long as the board is not reprogrammed
